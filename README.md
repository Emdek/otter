# Otter Browser

## A browser controlled by the user, not vice-versa

[**Otter Browser**](https://otter-browser.org/) aims to recreate the best aspects of **Opera 12** and to revive its spirit. We are working on providing the powerful features power users want while keeping the browser fast and lightweight. We also learned from History and decided to release the browser under the GNU GPL v3.

We have [an official forum](http://thedndsanctuary.eu/index.php?board=9.0) and two IRC channels at Freenode: [#otter-browser](http://irc.lc/freenode/otter-browser) and [#otter-browser-pl](http://irc.lc/freenode/otter-browser-pl) (polski / Polish).

Selection of planned features:

* Extensions support (WebExtensions like Chrome and Firefox)
* Tab grouping (stacking *and* panorama)
* Browser synchronisation
* RSS client
* Mail client

A more complete list is available in the *TODO* file. Details on already implemented features are available in the *CHANGELOG* file.

## Install

You can either compile Otter Browser from source by following the instructions in the *INSTALL* file, or use pre-compiled binaries.

Linux users can use the official AppImage version available on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/otter-browser/files/) when available. The browser is also available in a the repositories of a wide range of Linux distributions and *BSD systems. Read more on [the dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/OtterBrowser/otter-browser/wiki/Packages).

Windows users can download the weekly releases on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/otter-browser/files/).

Unfortunatelly, we are unable to provide pre-compiled binaries for macOS at the moment. If you are willing to help us do so, read on.

## How to contribute

Otter Browser is *your* browser. Because it is free software (GPL v3), you can contribute to make it better. New contributors are always welcome, whether you write code, make resources, report bugs, or suggest features.

The browser is written in C++ from scratch and is based on the Qt5 framework, with some modules written in Javascript. Have a look on [open issues](https://github.com/OtterBrowser/otter-browser/issues) to find a mission that suits you.
